# eo-textmate
TextMate Plugin for Syntax Highlighting in EO Programs

# Installation
```
mkdir -p /Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
cd /Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
git clone https://github.com/objectionary/eo.tmbundle.git
```
At a later time you can update the bundles which you have installed by executing these two lines:
```
cd /Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
git pull
```
If TextMate is running while you perform the update, you may want to also reload bundles:
Bundles → Bundle Editor → Reload Bundles from within TextMate.
